## Advancing AI Through Music, Neural Networks, and Fuzzy Logic

Welcome to the **Rebecca Lin AI Lab** at Feng Chia University. We are a research laboratory dedicated to pushing the boundaries of artificial intelligence, with a particular focus on music generation, neural network architectures, fuzzy logic systems, and deep learning applications.

### Our Research Focus

We explore cutting-edge AI technologies across multiple domains:

- **Music & Audio AI**: Generation, classification, and semantic understanding of music through neural networks
- **Deep Learning**: Advanced neural network architectures including GANs, GRUs, and transformer models
- **Fuzzy Logic Systems**: Uncertainty handling and decision-making in AI systems
- **Image Analysis**: Computer vision applications for multimedia understanding
- **Recommender Systems**: Personalized content recommendation algorithms

### Featured Projects

Our lab has contributed to significant research projects including:

- **Muzic**: Music understanding and generation with AI (492+ stars)
- **BGT-G2G**: Retaining semantics in image-to-music conversion (accepted at IEEE ISM 2022)
- **Open NSynth Super**: Experimental physical interface for NSynth algorithm
- **Lyrics-Conditioned Neural Melody Generation**: Generating melodies from lyrics
- **Classical Piano Composer**: AI-driven classical music composition

### Open Source Philosophy

We believe in open science and making our research accessible to the global AI community. Most of our projects are open-source and available on GitHub under MIT and similar licenses.

### Get Involved

- **Students**: We welcome motivated students interested in AI research
- **Collaborators**: Seeking research partnerships in music AI and neural networks
- **Community**: Join our open-source projects and discussions
