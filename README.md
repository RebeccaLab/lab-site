## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/getting-started/installation/) installed on your system

### Local Development

To preview the site locally:

```bash
zola serve
```

Then open your browser to `http://127.0.0.1:1111`

The site includes live-reload, so changes to your content will automatically refresh in the browser.

### Build the Site

To build the production-ready site:

```bash
zola build
```

The built site will be in the `public/` directory.

### View the Site Locally

After building, you can also serve the built site:

```bash
cd public && python3 -m http.server 8000
```

Then visit `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.
